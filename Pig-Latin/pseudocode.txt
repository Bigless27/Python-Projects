-Turn the sentence into x many sub arrays that will be split on the white space.

-split the sub array up into individal characters so I am able to itterate through each word

-while itterating through each word in the sentence see if that letter is included is a predefined list of vowels that I will create.

-if: it is a match then return the word.
-else: it isn't a mathc then move all the consonats to the end of end of the word
  -stop moving consonates around when you hit a vowel
  -add "ay" to the end of the word and then join that word back together.

-repeat this process until every word has been converted to piglatin
